## Finding out if a game has a 32 or 64 Bits architecture ##

If you downloaded a ReShade Addon or tried to install ReShade manually you likely seen that the files end with 32 or 64.

That number shows in with architecture the addon or ReShade .dll file was made for.

If you have doubts on what file to install on your game, there is a very simple way to find out if the game is 32 or 64 bits.

Open the game you want to check and Alt+Tab out of it.

Then open up Task Manager and look for the process of the game.

If the game has a 32 bit architecture it should show up with the tag (32 Bits) after the process name.

If it does not have that then the game utilizes a 64 bits architecture.
