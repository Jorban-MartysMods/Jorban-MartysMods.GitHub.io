## Downloading:

iMMERSE comes in three different tiers:

| **Repository / Tier** | **Price & Download** |
| iMMERSE | No Purchase Required - [Downloadable on GitHub](https://github.com/martymcmodding/iMMERSE) |
| [iMMERSE Pro - Raytracers Tier](https://www.patreon.com/mcflypg/membership) | Purchased on Patreon for 5USD - [Downloadable on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/494578207505514496/494599998059839498) |

## Installing Shaders:

All shader archives & repositories follow the same basic install instructions that you can find in [our guide for installing ReShade shaders manually](https://guides.martysmods.com/docs/reshade/downloading-and-installing/#downloading-the-shader-repositorys)!

If you are installing iMMERSE Pro or iMMERSE Ultimate shaders, **DO NOT** install the iMMERSE Repository manually or through the ReShade installer. Doing so will cause duplicates of the iMMERSE base shaders - as they are included with the iMMERSE Pro and Ultimate archives.

---

## Installing Add-ons:

Since Addons stray a bit from the Shader install procedure they have to be installed differently. 

1. Open the iMMERSE Ultimate archive.

2. Afterwards, you need to open the "**Addons**" folder within the iMMERSE Ultimate archive.

    ![Image](./images/immerse_ultimate_addons.webp)

3. Once you're in the "**Addons**" folder of the iMMERSE Ultimate archive, navigate to your game folder where ReShade and the game exectuable exist. If you're unsure where your game directory is located, please see our guide on [how to locate your game's executable](https://guides.martysmods.com/docs/additional-guides/finding-your-game-executable-and-directory/) for assistance!

4. Now, simply drag and drop the addon files from the iMMERSE Ultimate archive into your game folder.
