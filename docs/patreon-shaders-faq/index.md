## Installing iMMERSE, iMMERSE Pro, and iMMERSE Ultimate Shaders

All shader archives & repositories follow the same basic install instructions that you can find in [our guide for installing ReShade shaders manually](https://guides.martysmods.com/docs/reshade/downloading-and-installing/#downloading-the-shader-repositorys)!

If you are installing iMMERSE Pro or iMMERSE Ultimate shaders, **DO NOT** install the iMMERSE Repository manually or through the ReShade installer. Doing so will cause duplicates of the iMMERSE base shaders - as they are included with the iMMERSE Pro and Ultimate archives.


## Installing iMMERSE Ultimate Add-ons

Addons stray a bit from the install procedure and can be installed by following the steps below:

First, start by opening the iMMERSE Ultimate archive.

## Navigate to the Addons Folder

Then, open the "**Addons**" folder within the iMMERSE Ultimate Archive

---

## Open Your Game Folder

Once you've opened the "**Addons**" folder in the iMMERSE Ultimate archive, navigate to your game folder where ReShade and the game exectuable exist. If you're unsure where your game directory is located, please see our guide on [how to locate your game's executable](https://guides.martysmods.com/docs/additional-guides/finding-your-game-executable-and-directory/) for assistance!

---

## Drag and Drop the Addons Into Your Game Folder

Lastly, simply drag and drop the addon files from the iMMERSE Ultimate archive into your game folder.
