<summary>Downloading and Installing iMMERSE Shaders and Addons</summary>

Created by Pascal Gilcher (also known as _Marty McFly_), iMMERSE is the successor to qUINT and features some of the most robust and well known shaders that are available for ReShade.

iMMERSE comes in three different tiers:

* iMMERSE (FREE)

* iMMERSE Pro (5 USD)

* iMMERSE Ultimate (9 USD)

<details markdown="block" class="details-tree">
<summary>iMMERSE</summary>

iMMERSE is the core repository of shaders from Pascal that are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/martymcmodding/iMMERSE).

The iMMERSE repository includes:

* iMMERSE Launchpad (Basic Requirement for all iMMERSE shaders.)

* iMMERSE MXAO

* iMMERSE Sharpen

* iMMERSE Anti-Aliasing (SMAA)

<summary>Downloading and Installing the iMMERSE Repository</summary>

To install the iMMERSE repository, utilize the ReShade Installer to download the iMMERSE repository during the shader installation process.

**Alternatively**, if you would like to install this repository manually, check out [our guide for installing ReShade shaders manually](https://guides.martysmods.com/docs/reshade-guides/downloading-and-installing-reshade/#step-1-create-a-reshade-shaders-folder)!

If you plan on installing iMMERSE Pro or iMMERSE Ultimate shaders, DO NOT install the iMMERSE Repository manually or through the ReShade installer. Doing so will cause duplicates of the iMMERSE base shaders - as they are included with the iMMERSE Pro and Ultimate archives.
