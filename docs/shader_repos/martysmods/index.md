# iMMERSE and qUINT

iMMERSE and qUINT are distinguished shader repositories developed by Pascal Gilcher, also known as MartyMcFly. 

These shaders are renowned for their significant performance increases over competing shader repositories and visual aesthetic, so much so that both iMMERSE and qUINT are widely adopted within the ReShade community and used by just about every ReShade user!
