# Installing ReShade to Grand Theft Auto V

## **Step 1:** Install ReShade

Start the process out by installing ReShade to GTAV normally.

Ensure that you are selecting the `GTAV.exe` exectuable when installing ReShade, otherwise you will be installing ReShade improperly.

If you need help with the ReShade installation, refer to [our guide on downloading and installing ReShade.](https://guides.martysmods.com/docs/basic-reshade-guides/downloading-and-installing-reshade/)<br>Remember that the ReShade Download and Installation guide is meant to be generic and to work for all games.
