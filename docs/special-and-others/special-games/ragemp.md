# Installing ReShade to RageMP

While FiveM is a multiplayer modification platform for Grand Theft Auto V, it requires the ReShade injection binary to be in RageMP's folder to run.

Unfortunately, this is the way that the developers of RageMP have set up their client, and there is nothing that we can realistically can do about it.

In order to install ReShade properly to RageMP, you can proceed with the following step based guide that is presented below:
