# RageMP

While RageMP is a multiplayer modification platform for Grand Theft Auto V, it requires the ReShade injection binary to be in RageMP's folder to run. Unfortunately, this is the way that the developers of RageMP have set up their client, and there is nothing that we can realistically can do about it. In order to install ReShade properly to RageMP, you can proceed with the following step based guide that is presented below:

{: .warning}
RageMP uses Easy Anti-Cheat. Any shaders which require the depth buffer or addons **will not work** when playing online. Additionally, you CANNOT use the addon enabled build of ReShade in RageMP.

## Downloading and installing ReShade

In order to download the latest copy of ReShade, navigate to the [ReShade Website](https://reshade.me).

In the ReShade Installer, click the browse function in the bottom right hand corner and File Explorer will open. Then, paste the location of the game into the address bar of the File Explorer Window that has oppened. Afterwards, click "ragemp_v.exe" and then click "Open" in the bottom right hand corner of the File Explorer Window.
