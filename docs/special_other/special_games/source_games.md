# Source Games
Source is an engine developed by Valve for their games.

This engine is used all over the gaming industry - that being said, some source games exhibit issues when it comes to loading ReShade, as source requires .dll files to be in a seperate folder.

Most of the time, the ReShade installer will take care of this, but if you are installing manually, or the ReShade installer didn't put it in the proper location - this is to document the locations for source games that the ReShade dll belong in.
