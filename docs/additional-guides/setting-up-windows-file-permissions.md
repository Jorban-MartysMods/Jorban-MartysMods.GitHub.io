# Windows File Permissions

Game distribution platforms like Steam, EA Play/Origin, Ubisoft Connect, and GOG Galaxy often use "Program Files (x86)" directories, which can restrict other software like ReShade from accessing necessary files. ReShade needs both read and write permissions to work properly.

## Identify the Game Directory

The game directory is usually indicated in the error message. However, if you need help finding it, refer to our guide on [how to find your game directory](https://guides.martysmods.com/docs/additional-guides/finding-your-game-executable-and-directory/).

## Access the Properties of Your Game's Root Folder

Right-click the game's root folder (e.g., "FINAL FANTASY XIV â€“ A Realm Reborn"), not the "game" folder. Then, click "Properties".

In the "Permissions Entry" window, click "Select a principal", then "Advanced", "Find Now", and double-click your username.

Ensure "Full Control" is selected under "Basic Permissions", then click "OK".

![Highlight of Full Control Being Selected for Basic Permissions](../images/setting-up-windows-file-permissions/basic_permissions_full_control.webp)

You should see your user listed with "Full Control" access. Click "OK" to finish.

Relaunch your game to verify that the permissions error is resolved.
