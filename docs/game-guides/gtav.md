# Grand Theft Auto V

Getting ReShade properly installed for Grand Theft Auto V can be challenging. A recent update from the developers introduced measures that block certain graphics injections, which has led to issues with ReShade and other similar tools not working as expected.

# Just ReShade

## Install ReShade through the ReShade Installer

To install ReShade for Grand Theft Auto V, use the ReShade Installer. If you're unfamiliar with the installation process, refer to [our guide on downloading and installing ReShade](https://guides.martysmods.com/docs/reshade-guides/downloading-and-installing-reshade/). Make sure to select the "GTAV.exe" executable when installing ReShade. Choosing the wrong executable will result in the ReShade Installer placing the incorrect ReShade binary in your game directory.

## Change the ReShade DLL name from "dxgi.dll" to "d3d12.dll"

Navigate to your Grand Theft Auto V folder by following [our guide for locating your game's executable](https://guides.martysmods.com/docs/additional-guides/finding-your-game-executable-and-directory/). Once there, rename the file "dxgi.dll" to "d3d12.dll".

# ReShade with ENB

## Download ENB for Grand Theft Auto V - Ignore if you already have ENB Installed

Go to the [ENB page for Grand Theft Auto V](http://enbdev.com/download_mod_gta5.htm). Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the latest version to view its changelog.

Then, click the download icon at the bottom of the changelog page.

## Install ENB for Grand Theft Auto V - Ignore if you already have ENB Installed

Open the archive you downloaded from the ENB page for Grand Theft Auto V.

![ENB Archive Image](../docs/game-guides/images/gtav-enb-archive.webp)

Next, enter the "WrapperVersion" directory.

![ENB Wrapper Version Directory](../docs/game-guides/images/gtav-wrapperversion-directory.webp)

Inside, you'll see several files:

![ENB WrapperVersion Files Image](../docs/game-guides/images/gtav-wrapperversion-files.webp)

These files are required for ENB. Copy each of them to the Grand Theft Auto V base directory. If you need help finding your Grand Theft Auto V base directory, follow [our guide for finding your game's executable and directory](https://guides.martysmods.com/docs/additional-guides/finding-your-game-executable-and-directory/).

## Make a copy of ENB's "d3d11.dll" and rename it to "d3d12.dll"

This step is necessary because the latest version of Grand Theft Auto V does not allow injection via "d3d11.dll". However, ENB doesnâ€™t work well with "d3d12.dll", so this workaround is needed. You should end up with two files that look identical to the image below.

## Install ReShade Normally

Finally, install ReShade as you normally would. Ensure that you target the executable named "GTAV.exe"; otherwise, the ReShade Installer will not copy the correct binary file, and ReShade will not function.
