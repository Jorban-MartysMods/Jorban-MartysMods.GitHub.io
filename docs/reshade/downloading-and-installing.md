# Downloading and Installing ReShade

ReShade enhances your video game visuals by adding effects like improved color depth and sharper details. It's compatible with most games and works with graphics APIs including DirectX, OpenGL, and Vulkan.

This guide is here to help you quickly download and install ReShade, ensuring you can easily upgrade your gaming experience. Follow the steps below to get started.

<details markdown="block" class="details-tree">
<summary>Downloading ReShade</summary>

The latest version of ReShade will always be avaliable at [ReShade's Homepage](https://reshade.me/#download).

![ReShade Homepage](../images/downloading-and-installing/rs_homepage.webp){: style="max-width:90%" }

Avalible for download are two builds of ReShade that you can select. The Standard, and Full Add-on Support build. Below, you can find information specifically on what differientiates the two builds, and the common usecases for them.

![ReShade Download Options](../images/downloading-and-installing/rs_download.webp){: style="max-width:90%" }

## Standard ReShade Build (Download ReShade x.x.x)

The Standard Build of ReShade is the most common version. It is ideal for online games with strict anti-cheat mechanisms (e.g., Dead by Daylight, PUBG, Apex Legends.) This build is used for online games due to its limitations to features to prevent misuse and cheating in online games. 

If you are unsure of what build to pick, this is likely the best choice!

## Full Add-On Support ReShade Build (Download ReShade x.x.x with full add-on support)

The Full Add-On Support Build of ReShade is best for offline games or games without anti-cheat systems (e.g., Final Fantasy XXIV, World of Warcraft, Baldur's Gate 3.) This build will offer the full feature set and freedom for creating presets with various shaders and add-ons.

If your game is offline, it's best to choose this build to prevent issues down the line!

<summary>Installing ReShade with the ReShade Installer</summary>

## Selecting Your Game

When opening the ReShade Installer, you'll be greeted with the option to choose what application that you want to install ReShade to. This part is very important, as if the wrong application or executable is selected, ReShade will not launch when your game starts.

![Game List](../images/downloading-and-installing/rs_game_list.webp)

If your game does not appear in the listing, click the "Browse..." button at the bottom right of the ReShade Installer. This button will open up a "File Explorer" window that will allow you to manually find your game's executable. 

If you are unsure of where the executable is located, check our [guide on finding your game's executable and directory](https://guides.martysmods.com/docs/additional-guides/finding-your-game-executable-and-directory/).

![Browse](../images/downloading-and-installing/rs_browse.webp){: style="max-width:90%" }

---

## Selecting the Rendering API

In order for ReShade to properly be installed, the ReShade Installer needs to know what Rendering API your game utilizes. The Rendering API has to be selected properly for ReShade to successfully inject, so make sure that you are getting this option correct, otherwise ReShade will not launch with your game.

If unsure which API your game uses, check [PCGamingWiki](https://pcgamingwiki.com) for details.

![ReShade Rendering API Selection](../images/downloading-and-installing/rs_rendering_api_select.webp)

---

## Installing Presets

ReShade presets, stored in `.ini` files, allow you to apply someone else's visual customizations, including shader configurations and hotkeys.

The ReShade Installer simplifies preset installation: just select the desired `.ini` file, and the installer automatically handles shader downloads and installations required by the preset.
![Preset Selection](../images/downloading-and-installing/rs_preset.webp)

If you don't have a preset to install, you can bypass this step by clicking "Skip" in the preset installation window's bottom right corner.

---

## Installing Shaders

Shaders are essential for enhancing game visuals through ReShade, offering a range of looks tailored by users. The ReShade Installer facilitates easy discovery and installation of these shaders.

Shaders are organized into repositories, displayed during the installation process. You can learn more about each by clicking on the blue-highlighted repository or author names.

![Shader Repository Links](../images/downloading-and-installing/reshade_installer_shader_repo_link_highlight.webp)

To install shaders, simply select the desired repositories and click "Next".

![Shader Repositories Selection](../images/downloading-and-installing/rs_shader.webp)

<details markdown="block" class="details-tree">
<summary>Check Tick</summary>

Selecting a repository with a **check tick** installs all shaders from that repository. Click "Next" to proceed with automatic installation.

![Check Tick Example](../images/downloading-and-installing/reshade_installer_shader_repo_check_tick.webp)

</details>

![Individual Shader Selection](../images/downloading-and-installing/rs_shader_select.webp)

</details>

---

## Installing Add-ons (Add-on Support Only)

Add-ons, introduced as a new feature in ReShade, expand customization through the ReShade Add-on API. They're primarily for users interested in exploring advanced features from both previous shader developers and current add-on creators.

Unless you're familiar with what an add-on does, it's recommended to avoid selecting any from the list to prevent potential game instability.

![Selecting Add-ons](../images/downloading-and-installing/rs_addon_select.webp)

---

## Finishing Up

Once the ReShade Installer completes, a confirmation screen will show up. Simply click the "Finish" button at the bottom right of the installer, then launch your game.

![Installation Complete](../images/downloading-and-installing/rs_complete.webp)

Upon successful installation, you'll see a ReShade banner in-game:

![ReShade In-Game Banner](../images/downloading-and-installing/rs_game_banner.webp)

If you don't see this banner, ReShade may not have been injected correctly. Try reinstalling, ensuring all steps are followed precisely.

## Download the ReShade Installer

The next step will be to download the latest ReShade installer from the [official ReShade website](https://reshade.me). The installer holds the ReShade binaries required in order to manually install ReShade.

---

## Download and Install 7Zip

This guide uses 7Zip in order to extract the ReShade binaries from the ReShade Installer. You can download and install the latest `.msi` version from [7Zip's official website](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html).

Keep in mind, that WinRar can serve as an alternative, but this guide utilizes 7Zip for convienence.

---
 
## Extract the ReShade Binary

Once 7Zip is installed, Right-click the ReShade Installer `ReShade_Setup_x.x.x.exe`, and hover over 7Zip, the select the "Open Archive" option.

![Open with 7Zip](../images/downloading-and-installing/reshade_setup_open_with_7zip.webp)

Upon clicking "Open Archive," a new window will appear that holds the two ReShade binaries. You can extract the DLL that relates to your game's architecture by draging the file out of the 7Zip window to your Desktop.

![Extract DLL](../images/downloading-and-installing/7zip_extract_reshade_binaries.webp)

| ReShade's 64-Bit Binary | ReShade64.dll |
| ReShade's 32-Bit Binary | ReShade32.dll |

---
 
## Rename the ReShade Binary

After you've extracted the right binary, right-click the `ReShadeXX.dll` and click "Rename." Afterwards you can rename the binary to the proper graphics injection name for the Rendering API that your game utilizes.

![Rename DLL](../images/downloading-and-installing/extacted_reshade_binary_rename.webp)

| DirectX 10/11/12 | dxgi.dll |
| DirectX 12 | d3d12.dll |
| DirectX 11 | d3d11.dll |
| DirectX 10 | d3d10.dll |
| DirectX 9 | d3d9.dll |
| OpenGL | opengl32.dll |

---
 
## Move the ReShade Binary

Lastly, you will need to move the renamed DLL into the root folder of your game, the same directory where the game's executable is located. If you're unsure of your game's executable location, follow [our guide on identifying your game's executable](https://guides.martysmods.com/docs/additional-guides/finding-your-game-executable-and-directory/).

![Place in Game Folder](../images/downloading-and-installing/place_reshade_binary_game_folder.webp)

Upon completion, your game should launch with ReShade injected!

<details markdown="block" class="details-tree">
<summary>Manually Injecting ReShade</summary>

Certain games do not support automatic ReShade injection during runtime.<br>This is especially common for UWP (Microsoft Store) games, which often disallow automatic injection. 

Thankfully, Crosire has developed a tool for manual DLL injection into games.

{: .note }
When manually injecting ReShade using Crosire's Inject Tool, you have to manually install shaders as well.

{: .warning} 
Crosire's Inject tool, being an external injector, is more likely to trigger anti-cheat systems. **Use with caution and at your own risk**.

## Downloading the Shader Repository(s)

This guide will be utilizing the iMMERSE repository on GitHub, however, you can utilize any shader repository for this guide. It's also worth noting that not all shader repositories are hosted the same way. So your downloading process may differ from the one shown here. If you do not need to download any shader repositories you can skip this part of the guide and continue onwards.

The first thing that you want to do, is to navigate to the GitHub repository of your choice. Once there, youc an click on the green "<> Code" button at the top right hand side of the repository.

![<> Code Button](../images/downloading-and-installing/github_shader_repo_code_button_highlight.webp)

Once you've clicked the "<> Code" button in github, a new button should appear within a dropdown called "Download ZIP." Click this and wait for the download to finish.

![Download Zip Button](../images/downloading-and-installing/github_download_zip_button_highlight.webp)

---

## Move the Shader Repositories Files to the Right Location

Now that you have all of the required files from the shader repository of your choice, you can navigate to the "ReShade-Shaders" folder that exists in the same directory as both your ReShade binary and game executable. Once there, open up the archive that you downloaded for the shader repository and merge the "Shaders" and "Textures" folders from the archive into the "ReShade-Shaders" folder.

![Copying Shaders and Textures Folders](../images/downloading-and-installing/c_and_paste_shaders_and_textures_folder.webp)

If Windows warns you of files already existing in that location with the names, simply click "Replace the files in the destination."

![Merge or Replace Files Prompt](../images/downloading-and-installing/windows_replace_prompt.webp)

---

## ReShade Settings for Shaders and Textures

If your ReShade install doesn't detect any new shaders installed, it's best to check the settings tab and verify that your shader's and texture's paths are set up correctly. These specific options are called "Effect Search Path" and "Texture Search Path."

![Shaders and Textures Search Paths Highlight](../images/downloading-and-installing/effect_and_texture_search_paths.webp)

You want to make sure that these two settings look identical to the configurations that are given below.

![Search Paths Example](../images/downloading-and-installing/image.webp)

| Effect Search Path | .\ReShade-Shaders\Shaders\** |
| Texture Search Path | .\Reshade-Shaders\Textures\** |

{: .note }
If you do not have a free slot to add a search path for, you can click the "**+**" icon located directly under the search paths!
