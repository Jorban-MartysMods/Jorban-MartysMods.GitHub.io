# iMMERSE Pro: Clarity

Clarity is a shader based on the feature of similar name in Adobe's software suites. It has the objective of highlighting and restoring otherwise hidden details by changing the image contrast locally.

The main difference of Clarity when compared to other shaders is that it has lots of features to avoid haloing or other artifacts.

Below is a guide to help with the tweaking of the shader and its values.

## Enable iMMERSE Pro: Clarity

Simply check the shader `iMMERSE Pro Clarity [MartysMods_CLARITY.fx]` in the "Home" tab of ReShade.

This will activate Clarity and give you the arguments at the bottom to change.

## Texture Intensity

"Texture Intensity" is responsible for how strong the sharpening / highlighting of the details are.

# Local Contrast Intensity

"Local Contrast Intensity" allows you to remove or add the image's contrast to combat haloing and artifacts while still keeping Clarity's highlight effect on.
