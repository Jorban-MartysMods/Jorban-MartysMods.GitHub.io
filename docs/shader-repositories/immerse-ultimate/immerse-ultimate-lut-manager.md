## Downloading and Installing LUTs

LUTs, are a format of predefined color grades. In ReShade, they're often in the format of your standard PNG file. You can browse common LUT repositories [such as MLUT](https://github.com/TheGordinho/MLUT) in order to view, find, and download LUTs at your pleasure to be used in LUT Manager.

Once you have the LUTs that you desire, create a folder in the root of your game folder named "LUTs" in the game directory and place the LUT textures that you've aquired inside. If you are struggling to find the location of your root game folder, please see our guide on [how to locate your gameâ€™s executable](https://guides.martysmods.com/docs/additional-guides/finding-your-game-executable-and-directory/) for assistance!
