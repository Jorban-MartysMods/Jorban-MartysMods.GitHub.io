# iMMERSE and qUINT

**iMMERSE and qUINT** are distinguished shader repositories developed by Pascal Gilcher, also known as _MartyMcFly_. 

These shaders are renowned for their significant performance increases over competing shader repositories and visual aesthetic, so much so that both **iMMERSE and qUINT** are widely adopted within the ReShade community and used by just about every ReShade user!
