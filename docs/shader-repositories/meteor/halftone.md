# Halftone

The Halftone shader is designed to simulate the halftone printing process, a technique commonly used in traditional printing to create gradients and shading through the use of dots. This shader reproduces that distinctive look, allowing you to apply a halftone effect to your images or scenes.

## Arguments

* **Grid Scale:** This setting allows you to adjust the scale of the dot grid, controlling the size and spacing of the halftone dots. Smaller values will produce finer dots with more detail, while larger values will create coarser dots with a more pronounced halftone effect.
