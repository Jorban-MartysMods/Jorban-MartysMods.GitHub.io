# Local Laplacian

Local Laplacian filtering is known for its exceptional ability to bring out details in an image by adjusting contrast locally, making it a powerful tool for achieving a refined and polished look. It is typically used in professional image editing software, such as Adobe Lightroom, under features like Clarity, Texture, and Dehaze. While traditionally it's not suitable for real-time processing due to its computational intensity, METEOR's iteration pulls off real-time rendering effortlessly.

## Parameters

* **Local Contrast Strength:** Controls the intensity of the local contrast enhancement. Increasing this value makes details more pronounced, while decreasing it can soften the image.
