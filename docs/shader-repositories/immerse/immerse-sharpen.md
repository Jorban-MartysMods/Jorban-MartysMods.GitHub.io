# iMMERSE: Sharpen

![sharpening comparison](../images/sharpen_comparison.png)

iMMERSE: Sharpen is a robust sharpener utilizing contrast based sharpening to get its results. Being a simple Sharpen shader, it doesn't have much control over over-sharpening or ringing, so everything should be tweaked with care. It is however, more effective than others at working with low values.

## Sharpen Intensity

iMMERSE: Sharpen has a single slider, **Sharpen Intensity**. This means that it takes very little in order to properly sharpen the scene. You will want to manage this argument where there is a noticble increase in game details, but not overly sharpening what there is to offer.

Start at the value of `0.000` and work your way up until you're able to find details being presnted more in the scene you've chosen.
