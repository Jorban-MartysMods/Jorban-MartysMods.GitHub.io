# iMMERSE: Sharpen

![sharpening comparison](../images/sharpen_comparison.png)

iMMERSE: Sharpen is a robust sharpener using contrast-based sharpening to achieve its results. As a simple sharpen shader, it lacks controls for over-sharpening or ringing, so adjustments should be made carefully. However, it is more effective at working with low values than other sharpeners.

## Sharpen Intensity

*  **Sharpen Intensity:** Configures the sharpness displayed on screen. Start with a value of `0.000` and gradually increase it until you see a noticeable improvement in game details without over-sharpening.
