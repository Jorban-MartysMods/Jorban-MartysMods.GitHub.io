# iMMERSE: Launchpad

iMMERSE: Launchpad is a utility shader designed to enhance the quality of normals and motion vectors, making them available for other shaders like RTGI and ReLight to use for more realistic lighting effects.

---

## Debug Parameters

* **LAUNCHPAD_DEBUG_OUTPUT:** Enables debug mode in Launchpad, allowing you to visually inspect the normals and motion vectors that the shader generates.

* **Debug Output Modes:** Switch between five modes to explore various aspects of Launchpadâ€™s outputs:
  * **All:** Displays a 2x2 grid showing normals, optical flow, depth, and the original image.
  * **Optical Flow:** Visualizes the motion data captured by Launchpad for use by other shaders.
  * **Optical Flow Vectors:** Shows the directional flow of motion in more detail.
  * **Normals:** Displays the enhanced normals provided by Launchpad.
  * **Depth:** Shows the depth map calculated by Launchpad.

---

## Arguments

* **Smoothed Normals:** Toggles the shader's ability to smooths the normals captured by Launchpad, providing softer lighting transitions in shaders like RTGI and ReLight compared to raw normals.

   <img src="../images/launchpad_normals_smoothed.webp" data-label="Smoothed">
  </div>

* **Textured Normals:** Toggle's the shader's ability to provide texture details to the normals generated by Launchpad. This feature helps shaders like RTGI and ReLight produce more detailed diffuse and specular lighting. Requires Smoothed Normals to be enabled.

   <img src="../images/launchpad_normals_textured.webp" data-label="Textured">
  </div>

* **Textured Normals Sample Radius:** Defines how far from the center Launchpad samples for textured normals. A larger radius may introduce artifacts and lower the quality of the normals.

  <div class="juxtapose" data-mode="horizontal">
   <img src="../images/launchpad_normals_textured.webp" data-label="0.000">
   <img src="../images/launchpad_normals_textured_sampleradius_1.000.webp" data-label="1.000">
  </div>

* **Textured Normals Intensity:** Controls the strength of the textured normals. High values can result in overly pronounced textures where they shouldn't appear.

  <div class="juxtapose" data-mode="horizontal">
   <img src="../images/launchpad_normals_textured_intensity_0.100.webp" data-label="0.100">
   <img src="../images/launchpad_normals_textured_intensity_0.500.webp" data-label="0.500">
  </div>

* **Textured Normals Quality:** Ranges from 1 to 3, determining the overall quality of the textured normals. Setting it to 3 will provide the best visuals, though you may need to lower it for performance reasons.
